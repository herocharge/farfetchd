The idea of percentage 1%, 2%, 3%, ...., etc. is something pretty much everyone of learns in school. It's a nice of way of capturing fractions. Instead of saying 1 hudredth, we can say 1 percent (rolls off the tongue easier too). We sometimes say 50% instead of half, to seem fancy perhaps. The number infront of the percent sign could be anything, so we can have 0.01% or 2000% and it still works (although a bit more confusing).

We as a society decided 100 was a nice thing to have a denominator. Why is this the case? Idk. Should we change? Idk. It could be because 100 things is probably the largest quantity we can comprehend? Idk again. 

Also I think we have some psychological association of size with respect to percentage. Like 0.1% sounds very low and 90% sounds pretty high. But that's not necessarily the case because at the end of the day - percentage is still a ratio. The actual value depends on the total value. I have definitely seen institutions abuse this association to make things seem bigger or smaller than they actually seem.

For example, take the statement "college X selects on 0.1% of the applicants!". One might infer that the college is very prestigious and is very selective! It kinda is. But that might not be the only reason why the percentage is low. A college can only support so many students. If the capacity of the college is only 100, then they have no choice but to reject the other candidates that they would've selected otherwise.

It also works the other way. If I optimized my software by 200%. It could mean something that used to take a whole day, now only takes half a day. It could also mean something that used to take 0.06 seconds, now only takes 0.03 seconds (Now this might actually be a significant improvement, CONTEXT MATTERS!)

Why did I decide to write this? Eh.. Idk, I'm just procrastinating from doing actual work and this makes me feel productive.
