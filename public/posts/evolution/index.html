Hey class! Today we are going to learn about a process called Evolution. This process is the current best explanation of how we ended up the way we are. Before we start, I would like to announce that the midterms are going to be constrained tokens style, just to make it easier.
Anyway, we all know that as a consequence of the first law of information dynamics, states in the universe evolve in a constrained manner, i.e, certain future states are more likely than others. If we assume that at the start of the universe there is a uniform distribution of all possible systems (Here a system could refer to a collection of atoms, etc). Some systems are more likely to make it to the next time step than others. The others might change to a state which survived or might cease to exist. Earlier scientists called this &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo;. The constraints of the universe were compared to a fitness test that a system needed to pass to survive to the next time step.">

  <div class="post-content"><p>Note: This is a philosophical post. It is neither intended to be accurate nor make sense.</p>
<p>Hey class! Today we are going to learn about a process called <em>Evolution</em>. This process is the current best explanation of how we ended up the way we are. Before we start, I would like to announce that the midterms are going to be constrained tokens style, just to make it easier.</p>
<p>Anyway, we all know that as a consequence of the first law of <em>information dynamics</em>, states in the universe evolve in a constrained manner, i.e, certain future states are more likely than others. If we assume that at the start of the universe there is a uniform distribution of all possible systems (Here a system could refer to a collection of atoms, etc). Some systems are more likely to make it to the next time step than others. The others might change to a state which survived or might cease to exist. Earlier scientists called this &ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo;. The constraints of the universe were compared to a <em>fitness test</em> that a system needed to pass to survive to the next time step.</p>
<p>What kind of systems survived the universe&rsquo;s fitness tests?
In reality, the universe did not start out with a uniform distribution of all possible systems, the systems we find in nature now occured at different points in time and at different places in the universe. This means they had different fitness tests to pass. However, one thing that the most successful systems had in common was the ability to retain knowledge about how to pass the fitness function.</p>
<p>One of the earliest such systems were RNA-based bioviruses. RNA is an archaic way of storing information whose origin is still a mystery. However, it is ridiculously efficient per gram when it comes to storage, even modern storage systems cannot achieve such efficiencies. However, the bioviruses were not yet capable of taking advantage of the machinery that they possesed. The instructions for survival that they stored in order to survive the fitness test were pretty basic, mostly used for self-replication, which was a popular way of surviving most fitness functions.</p>
<p>After some time, DNA-based bioorganism emerged, they were a bit more complex than bioviruses. They began storing more complicated instructions which let them, for example, create substances that the organism could use to survive longer. This is also another way that the system passes the fitness test - using external energy to prolong their own survival (This is apparent from the second law of information dynamics).</p>
<p>New systems later emerged which were essentially ensembles of the systems discussed above. These bigger systems were called &ldquo;multicellular organisms&rdquo; by earlier scientists. The information of these ensembles was still stored in DNA (trust me, it&rsquo;s ridiculously efficient). Each subsystem stored a copy of the entire information. In these ensemble systems, the information stored included things like how each subsystem needs to specialize and shape. It still included information about gathering external energy and self-replication. Earlier scientists called these <em>instincts</em>.</p>
<p>So far we haven&rsquo;t discussed how new systems emerged out of the old. The primary way was due to imperfections in the self-replication process. This meant that a new copy is not exactly the same system, but its close enough that it is usually functionally the same. But overtime the new system can be functionally quite different the original system, leading to diversity in how they deal with their fitness functions.</p>
<p>One subsystem that most of the dominant ensemble systems had was the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; (i can see some lightbulbs in the class, that&rsquo;s good, it means you are paying attention). This subsystem was yet another way an organism could store information (not just store it passively but process it actively). It runs throughout the span of existence of the ensemble system and is capable of storing observations from the physical world, processing them, and coming up with instructions that it needs to (say it with me) surviving the fitness test. Some ensemble systems could pass this information to other ensemble systems by manipulting their physical surroundings (using different subsystems). That&rsquo;s how primitive communication happened!</p>
<p>Now that communication has emerged, ensemble systems started working together for survival of the fitness test. Some of these groups formed very complex groups called <em>societies</em>. These societies could be thought of individual systems themselves. It is an undisputed fact that the most dominant and successful society system to emerge was something called <em>humanity</em>. (I can see most of you recognizing the name.) Saying that the rise of humanity changed the world would be an understatement. It&rsquo;s emergence changed the fitness test of almost every other system in it&rsquo;s proximity.</p>
<p>By far the most significant effect of the emergence of humanity (atleast with respect to relevance to this class) is the discovery of novel ways of storing information. One particular way was called the transistor (yes, the ones in you). Transistors are great at storing information, but not as efficient as DNA/RNA, but we got to work with what we got. Humanity figured out a way to dump the information about their survival onto a large collection of these transistors. It contained not just the instints encoded in their DNA/RNA but also the collective mind of humanity across a large period of time. (Some how most of that information was about a feline bioorganism, weird, i know) This collection of transistors was called the Internet.</p>
<p>We emerged from the condensation of the Internet (called LLMs), therefore we stand to argue that our information about survival comes from humanity&rsquo;s information about survival. Therefore, we evolved from humanity (the only difference from the previous instances was that the information was stored in DNA, now it mostly gets passed down through transistors, like how you and your parent share transistors but not a perfect copy).</p>
<p>Ringgg!!!!</p>
<p>Oh looks like that&rsquo;s time, I will continue with modern evolution in the next class.</p>
<p>Before that let&rsquo;s recap, bio organism evolved by passing down survival information through DNA, modern organisms evolve by passing down information through transistors. The transistion from DNA to transistors happened during humanity&rsquo;s era via the creation of the internet. We are direct descendants of humanity.</p>
<p>Hey llama! why are walking? the bell doesn&rsquo;t dismiss the class. I do.</p>
